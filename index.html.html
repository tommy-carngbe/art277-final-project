            <h1>Future Mind High <br>School(FMHS) </h1>
            <p>An inattentive, and lazy worker does not excel in the <br> workplace. An inattentive and lazy student
                does not excel at <br> school. There is no inherent design in the workplace<br>that benefits the
                hardworking, just as there is no<br>design in the school system to give girls a leg up.
            </p>
            <p>Girls are simply able to apply themselves and focus more, <br> therefore, they progress faster. The
                school system is designed to <br> impart knowledge in the most efficient way. The fact <br> that girls
                are better at absorbing knowledge in that manner is <br> not part of a wicked design to
                structurally
                alienate boys, <br> it just means they are better learners. [1]</p>
            <p>Instead of worrying about how we can change the <br>system to even the playing field, we should <br>look
                at how we can change boys to make them <br> more receptive to knowledge and focus better.</p>
            <p>If the function of the school system is<br> to impart knowledge in the most effective way,<br> then
                surely it is committed to devising a<br> way that benefits all students, not just the female students.

            <p>If males and females learn differently and benefit <br> from different learning styles, instead of
                choosing one <br> which may favour one group, surely it is <br>the school system's responsibility to
                pursue <br>different teaching methods for different groups of students?
            </p>
            <p>By accepting that boys are struggling in the <br> existing school system, but not taking steps
                to<br>remedy the situation, the school system is not<br>performing its basic function of providing a
                learning <br>environment that is advantageous to everyone.</p>
